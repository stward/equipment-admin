__A basic outline__

This is a simple outline of what we want the admin page for equipment quotes to look like.

The main page is a list of all the equipment, with full details for now (this can be changed to a simplified list, we'll see what the powers that be think).

The name of the equipment links to an edit page, which is a form of text fields pre-filled with the equipment's info.

Next to or below the equipment name are the details it has.

Next to the details is a delete button, which requires a confirmation prompt before the deleting actually happens.

Below the table of equipment is a big create button. This takes you to a page to make a new equipment for the table which is mostly the same as the edit page, except the text fields will be empty. We'll have to check out the viability of reusing that page.
